# Build Requirements

This project targets the **PIC16F1936** microcontroller and was developed using the **MPLAB X IDE** and **XC8 compiler**. It can be built either using the MPLAB environment or from the command line, assuming the appropriate toolchain is installed and configured.

## Required Tools

| Tool             | Version Tested | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [MPLAB X IDE]    | v6.x           | Integrated development environment (IDE) for Microchip embedded systems.    |
| [XC8 Compiler]   | v2.x           | Compiler for 8-bit PIC and AVR microcontrollers.                            |

- **Target Microcontroller**: `PIC16F1936`
- **Configuration**: `default` â†’ `production`

[MPLAB X IDE]: https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide
[XC8 Compiler]: https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-xc-compilers

## Build via MPLAB X IDE

1. Open the `.X` project folder (or main folder containing `nbproject/` and `Makefile`) in MPLAB X IDE.
2. Select the correct compiler toolchain (`XC8`).
3. Choose the configuration: **default [production]**.
4. Build the project using the **Clean and Build** option.

---

## Optional: Build from Terminal

If you have the XC8 compiler and MPLAB X make tools correctly installed and available in your system PATH:

```bash
make
```

> Note: This uses the `Makefile` and `nbproject/` structure auto-generated by MPLAB X. Ensure `cmd.exe` or equivalent is resolvable if using Windows paths inside Linux.

---

## Directory Notes

- `nbproject/`: IDE-generated project metadata (do not modify manually).
- `build/`, `dist/`: Auto-generated folders containing compiled binaries (can be ignored via `.gitignore`).
- `src/`: Contains `main.c`, peripheral configuration (`mcc_generated_files/`), and custom LCD library.
- `Makefile`: Generated build instructions for command-line compilation.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the correct version of the XC8 compiler is installed.
- If building via terminal fails with `cmd.exe not found`, consider building from MPLAB IDE directly.
- Missing `xc.h` or headers? Verify MPLAB and XC8 paths are correctly set in your environment or project properties.
